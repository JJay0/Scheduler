# Scheduler

First, create a list of all the students, and assign each person a combination of a letter (A-H) and number (1-7); signifying the free periods they have that can be turned into a class. Then create categories based on the letter and numebr; for example, A2: (Bob, Smith : Josh, Tyler : CJ, Kearney). This enables the programmer to see the choices they have to put who into what class. If there should only be a certain amount of people in the class, and there is more than the maximum amount availibale, randomize the names and pick the top students to be in the class. Towards the end of the program, start prioritzing who has the least amount of classes so that everyone meets the minimum requirement of how many classes one should have. Another extra part that can be included into this is the wants of the students. Like what are the classes they want the most and the least. Maybe create a whole nother criteria besides Letter and number. Add a number, 1 being they wanted the class the most, 5 being they did not want it at all. Based on these mnumbers, prioritize the people who wanted that class the most, and move the others further down the list.
